# SE310_Debugger_Exercise

Description: Main.java is intended to find the diff between two input files (file1.txt, file2.txt). However, there is a (logical) error in Main.java, and the diff calculated for the given input files is incorrect. 

**Try to find the error using only your IDEs debugger.**
Try each of the debugging toolbar options (play, step-over, step-into, etc)
Set some inline breakpoints, and check variable values at those points
